# python-math-attack

This was a another personal project I did with python. It's called Math Attack. Like the name implies, 
the player is barraged with as many questions as they choose with difficulties ranging from easy to hard.
After choosing their options, the player will answer as many questions as possible and after completing the challenge,
will be given their score.

This script was written to run in the command line.
